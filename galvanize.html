      <div>
        I am excited to begin my training at Galvanize. For the last 6 months, I have been studying the Microsoft stack with the help of a friend. I had started learning MVC, but most of what I have learned has been back-end stuff. I'm excited to be learning not only front end technologies, but the whole stack in guided way. When the program is completed, I'd like to find work a one of the fine companies here in Boulder.

      <h2> The GIF </h2>
      <div>
        The act of selecting the perfect GIF to represent one’s mental, emotional, and spiritual state when entering a program of such caliber is a daunting task. How can so many different aspects of one’s being be distilled down into a single 7 second looping video clip? 7 seconds to capture the excitement of starting something new. 7 seconds to capture the wonder of of so many web compatible technologies. 7 seconds to capture the honor of studying at the feet of such venerated teachers. 7 seconds to capture the nervous voice in an man’s head that asks, “Am I good enough? Am I really worthy?” 7 seconds to capture a man’s wit. 7 seconds to capture the disparity between a man’s lofty goals and the skills he brings to the program. <br><br>

        A daunting task indeed. Like countless others before me, I too stepped up to shoulder this burden. To complete this task, I knew I was going to have to dig deep. I would have to be prepared physically, mentally and spiritually for this quest. To prepare mentally, I limbered my mind with the likes of Foucalt and Rousseau balanced with some Nietzsche, Reddit, and Adult Swim. To prepare spiritually I engaged in some deep interpersonal relational meditation, had my chakras balanced and then sang Kumbaya with some hippies in Boulder. To prepare physically I alternated between the 8 forms of pranayama yoga and purification through sweat lodges with a Paiute shaman. For diet, well, this is Boulder and I’m doing a cleanse, which means I can’t eat any cheese or red meat and I’m all farty and it sucks and I don’t really want to talk about it. <br><br>

        Preparations behind me I dove into the internet to search. I shan’t list the myriad places I ventured on my quest, nor shan’t I list the things found in therewith. The internet is dark and full of terrors, and sometimes when you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you. Suffice it to say, I saw things. Some horrifying. Some titilating. I learned things about who I am. Things were left behind in my search. Other things were brought back with me. In the end, my strength of character won out and I emerged from the mouth of my man cave, GIF in thumb drive, victorious. It was the Hero’s Journey really.<br><br>

        After much ado, but without further ado, I present, the GIF (converted to .mp4 for size):<br><br>
