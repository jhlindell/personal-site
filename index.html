        <h1>BIO</h1>
        I'm 41 years old and recently divorced. I have two boys. Jonas is 7, and Miles is 4. As part of the rebuilding of my life, I am transitioning into a career as a programmer. I enjoy the puzzle solving aspect of coding, and I enjoy working collaboratively with others. <br><br>
        I grew up in Wausau, a small town in north central Wisconsin. I got a business degree from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. If you root for the Bears, I apologize in advance, but we might not get along (just kidding (mostly)). <br><br>
        After college, I headed out west to the mountains. I brewed beer professionally for a while. I was a massage therapist for a while. I was a real estate investor for a while. Now I will write code. <br><br>
        Interests include snow skiing, water skiing, aikido, long naked walks in the tall grass, cooking, reading, mixing cocktails, watching movies, exploring the esoteric and philosophic mysteries of the universe, squanching.
